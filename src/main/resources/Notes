        //finished : Memory: number of event* number of queries that this event is in
        //finished : EACH EXPERIMENT, run 3 times, Take average
        //finished : Event types only appear once in a query

        //keep the current processing of NYC dataset


        1. Hamlet ran so fast on NYCTaxi/SmartHome, latency looks not stable(too few event types in the query)
        2. memory is not growing with the number of queries. only one relevant event type for each query
