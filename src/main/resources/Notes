 * Questions:
 *          1. how to compare the memory of greta and hamlet
 *          2. Trend count computation implementation is about predicates, right?
 *          3. update final count is implemented differently, now when a shared graphlet is finished, we update the final count,
 *          event type is not considered.
 *          4. no snapshot table, only one snapshot is maintained has a hashtable for different queries.
 *          5. cannot process non-shared kleenes



        //TODO: default number of quries, 20
        //TODO: test with my queries, 但是短一点的stream，比较hamlet与greta是否一致


        // TODO: add experiment of number of queries(lat, memory, throughput), compare shraon, greta, hamlet, MCEP.
        // using synthetic data，到底用Allison的data，改hamlet，还是改sharon,MCEP, 用我的stream/workload

        //TODO:  then real-dataset，compare stock dataset with physical, choose a better one, can use a subset of original data,
        //        //  find a best stream in the data stream
        // TODO: 2020/2/28 events with same timestamp should have no predecessor relationship
        // TODO: DEBS dataset
