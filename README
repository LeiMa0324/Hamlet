Main function: ~/src/main/java/executor/main.java

Main function includes four experiments in the paper:
- Hamlet versus state-of-the-art approaches(Ridesharing data set)
    Figure 14, 16
    output directory: ~/output/RideSharing

- Hamlet versus state-of-the-art approaches(NY City Taxi data set)
    Figure 15
    output directory: ~/output/NYCTaxi

- Hamlet versus state-of-the-art approaches(Smart Home data set)

    output directory: ~/output/SmartHome

- Dynamic versus static sharing decision (Ridesharing data set)
    Figure 17
    output directory: ~/output/RideSharing


For the first three experiments, we run two methods varying:
    - the events per window
    - the number of queries

For the last experiment, we run two methods varying:
    - the events per window
    - the burst size


In each of these methods, we run the models several iterations and log the results of latency, throughput and memory for each model in each iteration.
Plots are based on the average of these results of an experiment.
outputs are under ~/output/"dataset", file name is in EXP_[X]_[method].csv form
